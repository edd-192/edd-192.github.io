    <a>This scratch project is the first project I created by myself with novice skills in scratch. Simple, yet fun for me to code and use, coding this project was fairly easy as long as I knew what I wanted the penguin to perform

      <a>This is the second project which is a story (or animation) I created with a classmate which is also the longest project made in the class. The total run time of this story is about 7 minutes from start to finish. which took us about a whole month to finish, first week we used to plan our story and the other three weeks to work on the coding.
